To import data: php import <filename>
	Data importer by default uses data.txt as its data store. It will be created if it doesn't exist.
	The path to the data file can be changed in include.php.

To run a query: php query.php <options>
	SELECT:
		-sFIELDS,TO,SELECT:<optional aggregate function>
		 Aggregate functions can be added to any fields with a colon (:) character after the name.
		 Aggregation functions include:
		    min
		    max
		    sum
		    count
		    collect
	GROUP BY (required for aggregate functions):
		-gGROUPBY-FIELD
	ORDER BY:
		-oFIELDS,TO,ORDER,BY
	FILTER:
		-f'FIELD=VALUE AND/OR FIELD2=VALUE2'

	Make sure there is no space between the option letter and the parameter.

PHP version: 5.4.24

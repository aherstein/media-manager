To import data:
	php import <filename>
	Data importer by default uses data.txt as its data store. It will be created if it doesn't exist.
	The path to the data file can be changed in include.php.

To run a query:
	php query.php <options>
	***Make sure there is no space between the option letter and the parameter. e.g. -sTITLE,DATE***

	SELECT:
		-sFIELDS,TO,SELECT:<optional aggregate function>
		 Aggregate functions can be added to any fields with a colon (:) character after the name.
		 Aggregation functions include:
		    min
		    max
		    sum
		    count
		    collect
	GROUP BY (required for aggregate functions):
		-gGROUPBYFIELD
	ORDER BY:
		-oFIELDS,TO,ORDER,BY
	FILTER:
		-f'FIELD=VALUE AND/OR FIELD2=VALUE2'

PHP version: 5.4.24

For this coding challenge, I chose to use PHP, since it works well in the command line. In addition to the import and
query scripts, I implemented a few classes:
	Data: for accessing the raw data file and converting it into object format
	DataItem: for representing a single data item
	TransformedData: for non-destructively modifying the data in a series of transformations. Each query type
		(select, order by, filter, aggregation, etc.) is executed as an independent transformation that modifies a
		temporary data object. When the select function is called, the data is printed to the screen.
